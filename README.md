# Tom's Personal Site
Welcome to Tom's personal site.

## Goals
The goal of the site is to maintain an incredibly low footprint, and allow for easy edge node caching in order to keep load times as low as possible.

The index is designed to not be cached. Weighing ~3.9KB. The total size of the code assets are around 14KB non-gzipped.

## Snake
The snake game is implemented using my [parallel snake engine](https://github.com/tomarrell/snake) and the built in web adapter.

## Analytics
I use self-hosted [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) analytics across my personal site and blog.

## License
Dual licensed, MIT or GPLv3.0 at your choice.
