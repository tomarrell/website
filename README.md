# Tom's Personal Site
Welcome to Tom's personal site.

## Goals
The goal of the site is to maintain an incredibly low footprint, and allow for easy edge node caching in order to keep load times as low as possible.

## Snake
The snake game is implemented using my [parallel snake engine](https://github.com/tomarrell/snake) and the built in web adapter.

## Analytics
I use self-hosted [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) analytics across my personal site and blog.

## License
Dual licensed, MIT or GPLv3.0 at your choice.
